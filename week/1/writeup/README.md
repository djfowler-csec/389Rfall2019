I believe ethically that it is very important to tell someone. Initially tell your boss, if that doesn't work properly  than it might be better to go up the food chain and speak to someone more involved. Although it's very possible that these people act to benefit shareholders as most company's do. If this doesn't work than it might actually be better to be a whistleblower, if the company shoots you down and is about to release the ECU which is capable for taking lives, theres is a very real chance that the public deserves to know that this company doesn't care about the consumer. I strongly believe that a company that doesn't worry about the safety of people/consumers isn't a company worth working for. It's very possible to hop to another job that will hopefully value the work you do and listen to the results provided. If the ECU rolls out as is there is a very compelling argument to be made that argues where the fault lies. Of course you did your due dilligence and told the management about the issue. However, was that enough? Should you have gone further as to lose your job after going public? I think there is only so much the auditor can do before the fault should really be on the management. If nothing is done about it, fault is undoubtly on the auditor, but on the other hand should the auditornotify management of the problem and nothing changes I believe that most of the fault transfers from the auditor to the management and the company itself.
